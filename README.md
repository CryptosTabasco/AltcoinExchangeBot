# AltcoinExchangeBot
Automate transaction backend through multiple exchanges through a bot backend.

## Objective
Streamline the management of cryptocurrency through the use of exchanges api and fiat apis. The goal is to be able to quickly process crypto to exchanges to banks in a transparent way. 

The application will have a dashboard with a keystore for the different APIs from the different exchanges. It will also have fiat exchanges which will allow to make deposits to a specific bank account. 

## Specs
This application could work on _Python_ or _NodeJS_ with a web interface and processing of trades between the different exchanges.
